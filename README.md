# TranslateAR

By: Ruby, LJ, and Lizzy

##  Application Summary

An Augmented Reality Language translation app. Users use their phone camera and the app identifies object in a space, when the application recognizes an object it shows the English word and then the language translation beside it. For example if a user points their camera at a cup the text that will appear is “cup” and “cup” In whatever language the user specifies. This could be used in situations where a user needs to know a word for an object in a room/wants to learn the object’s name in a different language. 

## Goals
Base Goal: An application that recognizes objects in a room and translates the names of them from a photo. Translates only to common Roman Languages: French, Spanish, Italian etc. 

Stretch goal: An application that recognizes objects in a room and translates them live while a user videos a space. Translates to all languages.
